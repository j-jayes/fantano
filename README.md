# Fantano Album Score Prediction Project

## Purpose

I want to create a model which predicts album score as rated by Anthony Fantano, the internet's busiest music nerd, from the language he uses in his review.

## Context

Fantano reviews music. The majority of his reviews are albums. He has a [website](https://www.theneedledrop.com/) which lists his reviews. He has a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt7fwAhXDy3oNFTAzF2o8Pw) that he uploads his reviews on. See a sample below.

## Structure

The project will have three parts:

The first is a data collection exercise. 

The second is some exploratory data analysis and cleaning.

The third is to build a model to predict album score from language of the review.

### Data collection

I plan to make a scraper that first scrapes [The Needle Drop website](https://www.theneedledrop.com/) to get the complete list of reviews, scores and links to the youtube videos.

Then I need to scrape the transcripts from the Youtube reviews.

### EDA and cleaning.
